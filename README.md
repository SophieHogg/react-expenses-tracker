# Expense Tracker (in progress)

A simple expense tracker created using React.
Stack: HTML, SCSS, React

This project is in progress; the visual elements are almost finished but the technical/logic is incomplete and is yet to be added.

Loosely based on this tutorial by Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ).

## MVP

-   Have a balance, an income and an expenses component
-   List all transactions
-   Allow adding new transactions
-   Allow deletion or editing of transactions in case of a misinput/mistype

## Extensions

-   Dark Mode/Light Mode (default is dark mode)

# Styling and Graphic Design

## Colour Palettes

-   Dark mode with a range of blues, dark blue-greys and white elements. Inspired by a stylised image of a whale shark. Also features some more dull greens and purples for the expenses/income element, to help it stand out without being too in-your-face.
-   Light mode with bright yellows, oranges and browns. Inspired by a stylised image of a giraffe. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

## Responsiveness (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

This app is currently responsive down to approximately a 630px wide screen. The goal is for this to be accessible on screen sizes down to approximately 360px (the approximate with of the Galaxy S20, and narrower than the iPhone 11 and the Galaxy Note 20.)
I would usually go with the Bootstrap grid system, however the minimum there is only 576px, so I will opt for a more customised option for approx 360-450px (depending on how it looks best for each screen size.)
