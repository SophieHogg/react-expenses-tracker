# Expense Tracker (in progress)

A simple expense tracker created using React.
Stack: HTML, SCSS, React

Loosely based on this tutorial by Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ).

## MVP

-   Have a balance, an income and an expenses component
-   List all transactions
-   Allow adding new transactions

## Extensions

-   Dark Mode/Light Mode
-   Allow deletion or editing of transactions in case of a misinput/mistype

## Initial Graphic Design Thoughts

-   Dark mode with a range of blues, dark blue-greys and white elements. Inspired by a stylised image of a whale shark.
-   Light mode with bright yellows, oranges and browns. Inspired by a stylised image of a giraffe.

(more details to be fleshed out at time of creation)
